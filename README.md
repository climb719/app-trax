#AppTrax

This is the frontend portion of the application APptrax. If you have not done so already, please first visit this link https://github.com/climb719/app-trax-backend 

You will need to get the backend set up and running first. Once that is set up, you are just a step or two away from using this app. To  add the front end:
If you are on a Mac, double click on the "index.html" 
If you are on Windows,  right click on the "index.html" file and select "reveal in explorer."  When your file explorer opens up, you will click on the "index" file. Make sure you are not trying to select "index.js" with either of these steps.

If you are set up correctly on your backend and your rails server is running, you should see the AppTrax open up with the status heading and a field to sign in. Use an email address and sign up or sign in. No password required. Now, you can start adding and tracking the jobs you apply for. 

Good luck with your application process!
